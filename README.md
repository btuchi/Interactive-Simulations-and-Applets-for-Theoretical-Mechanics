## üìñ Background & Theory

### Variational Calculus
The calculus of variations finds functions that extremize integrals. In physics, this leads to:
- **Euler-Lagrange Equations:** Fundamental equations of motion
- **Principle of Least Action:** Nature minimizes the action integral
- **Hamilton's Principle:** Generalization of Newton's laws

### Action Integral
The action S is defined as:
```
S = ‚à´ L dt = ‚à´ (T - V) dt
```
where L is the Lagrangian, T is kinetic energy, and V is potential energy.

### Key Physics Concepts
- **Conservation Laws:** Energy, momentum, angular momentum
- **Phase Space:** Position and momentum representations  
- **Harmonic Motion:** Fundamental oscillatory behavior
- **Central Forces:** Gravitational and electromagnetic interactions
